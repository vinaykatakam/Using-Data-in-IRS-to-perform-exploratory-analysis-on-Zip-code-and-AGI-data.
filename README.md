Using Data in IRS to perform exploratory analysis on Zip code and AGI data.
#  OVERVIEW
We would like to study and make an analysis using Data in IRS to perform exploratory analysis on Zip code and AGI data.  We would like to use the data from IRS https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Statistics-ZIP-Code-Data- (SOI). On this data we are going to look at relations between AGI and zip codes and how this data was thought out the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. We see which zip codes have fared throughout the years. Which zip codes improved in the average AGI and which have depreciated? As an end product we are planning to provide a web app where they enter zip code to see how it fared through the years, compare zip codes and see gentrification in some cities.  
# DATA
We take Data driven of IRS from https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Individual-Income-Tax-Statistics-ZIP-Code-Data- (SOI).  
Our initial aim is to pull data from the IRS link above using that we would like to create a web app where a user can retrieve the trend in property values (gentrification) using zip code throughout the years . 
# RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
As our research paper would state research points we would like to consider and retrieve the trend in property values (gentrification) using zip code throughout the years by removing the unwanted bits from the data by cleaning it. 
# MODELS AND ANALYSIS 
We are planning our models and preliminary analyses will be performed in a Jupyter Notebook and development in python. 
  
# CODE AND APPLICATION 
We are considering to collaborate on developing the Web API and implantation of code and post the code in our GitHub repository and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level. 
# PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
We are team of three, Vinay Kumar Katakam, Uday Kirshna Reddy Vinjamuri and Akhila Priya Chilukuri and we will be sharing our work among ourselves. Vinay Kumar will be taking care of development, data analysis, Back end work consisted of an API that was created to provide data to the front end. And Writing O Auth script to pull linked in Connections and Uday Kirshna and Akhila Priya would work on data set, data analysis and UI development and together we are collaborating to check the progress of the project testing.
